# Step by Step Guide on Creating a Virtual Environment

## Step 1 - Vagrant
The first step is to download Vagrant (2.2.5) by HashiCorp and make sure to click on the 64 bit option. Once the installer is downloaded, complete the installation. To check if Vagrant is successfully installed, go to your terminal and insert 'vagrant -help' if command gives you the following output as shown in the screenshot below then the installation has been successful.
## Step 2 - Oracle VM VirtualBox
The next step is to download Oracle VM VirtualBox 6.0.10 and run the installation and make sure it is complete. Also make sure to download the extension pack from the website as shown below. To check if the extension go to the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager ---> File ---> Preferences ---> Extensions and then check if the extension is activated.
## Step 3 - Turn off Hyper-V
Make sure that Hyper-V is disabled, by going searching 'Turn Windows Features On or Off' on your search bar on the bottom of your screen. Then make sure that the Hyper-V is unticked. Once this is completed restart your computer as asked.
## Step 4 - Create Directory
The next step is create directory in the location of your choice using the 'mkdir' command. Once the directory has been created cd into the directory.
## Step 5 - Vagrant init
Once in the directory, enter the command 'vagrant init "ubuntu/xenial64"' into bash and press enter. This creates a vagrant file which is essentially file.
## Step 6 - Vagrant up
Once the vagrant file is created, enter 'vagrant up' into bash. This command will create a virtual machine. If you go to the VM VirtualBox Manager you will see the virtual machine appear and it should be running as shown below:
## Step 7 - Vagrant ssh
Once the virtual machine is running, insert 'vagrant ssh' to enter the terminal of the virtual machine. Open the vagrant file and remove all the comments from the file and keeping just the three lines shown below.
## Step 8 - Vagrant Plug in
Go to GitBash and cd into the directory which you are using. You then need to install the plug in, this can be done by inserting 'vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater' and pressing enter.
## Step 9 - Configure Network
Next, you need to make an IP address by inserting this into the vagrant file on Atom 'config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.10.100"', also create an alias for the IP address. For example 'config.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.local"]'.
## Step 10 - Vagrant Reload
Exit the virtual environment by entering exit in bash. Then insert vagrant reload to update the file which has been updated.
## Step 10 - Install nginx
The next step is to install nginx, by inserting the following command into bash 'sudo apt-get install nginx -y' and then 'sudo systemctl start nginx'.
## Step 11 - Check if Virtual Environment is working
To check if the virtual environment is working, open Internet Explorer or Edge or Chrome, etc and insert http://development.local into the url and press enter.
